# websockets-flask
this main.py has notes on much of the funtionality offered by flask-socket-io but not all of it is implemented yet

for set up you will need to pip install the following flask-socketio eventlet
to run you need to use the command python main.py
when you type into the chat and hit send they will print to the console on the backend for now (will be updated for more meaningful use soon)
