# websockets-flask
this main.py has notes on much of the funtionality offered by flask-socket-io but not all of it is implemented yet

for set up you will need to pip install the following flask-socketio eventlet


to run you need to use the command python main.py


when you type into the chat and hit send they will print to the console on the backend 

you can open two windows and have both connect to localhost 5000 and send messages and will show up on the frontend for both clients 



a special thank you to Nic Gauer for his help troubleshooting this
